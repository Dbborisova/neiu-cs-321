## Project Topic Proposal

#### 1.Application Name:
Cook Like Me.

#### 2.Project Topic/Objective:
I want to create a web application for sharing cooking videos and categories. Each user will have to log in and will have a personal private or public home page. The application will be used only for sharing cooking ideas. Social media but for cooking. Users will be able to have a group of friends (followers) and they will be able to exchange cooking videos. The application will perform different functions:

-Allow users to share videos and pictures.

-Create a cookbook.

-Use hashtags.

-Play games with your followers. (Challenge your follower to cook the dish you made and follow your recipe).

#### 3.Motivation:
I have been stuck at home for the last 4 months and ran out of cooking ideas. I am not the best cook, but I like to experiment with new categories. One day I was just wondering what to make for dinner so, I asked my friends to help me create a new dish. They sent me videos of what they made, and I follow their recipe. Social media can be overwhelming sometimes. I thought it will be useful and entertaining if there was a platform where users can share cooking ideas only.

#### 4.Server-Side Components:
The userâ€™s database can contain videos and pictures.
