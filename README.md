#### 1.Application Name:
Cook With Me.

#### 2.Project Topic/Objective:
Cook With Me, is a web based application that helps you organize your recipes.Instead of keeping your culinary ideas in books on the kitchen shelves,
or on pieces of paper in your kitchen drawers,with Cook With Me, you can digitalize your collection.The application focuses on building your own database
of recipes for quick recall for ease of use.

#### 3.How does it work?
Upon opening the app, all end users will have to register with standard information.Upon registering, the app will be ready for use,
and you will have your personal cookbook where you can write and store all of your favorite recipes.You can put them in categories, add ingredients, 
as well as write detailed descriptions.Also, you can save the calorie count, and the time needed for cooking your favorite meal. All your recipes will be organized
by category, and the result is a simple and easy way to find the desired dish. Some additional features includemodifying your recipe or removing it from the 
cookbook.


#### 3. How does it look?
Cook With Me has a simple and clean design for ease of use.The main navigation is standard horizontal menu and includes the application logo and useful links
such as log in, register, recipe, and content.Users should be able to navigate through the application without confusion. I chose neutral colors because I wanted
to give the application a modern and sleek look, but also prioritize usability.Everyone who is interested in cooking should be able to use the application, 
regardless of their technology capabilities or background.My goal was to give users the same feeling as when they write a recipe on a piece of paper, without 
overwhelming them with bright accent colors, and a lot of interactive content. 

#### 4. Goals.
Cook With Me is still work in progress. I would like to make the application more interactive and give users the option to upload images along with the recipe.
In order to do so, I need to create few more classes that deal with storing and loading files. Also, I would like to display the saved recipes in a different format,
which will make them easier to read.
In summary, I believe the application should not only be functional, but fun and easy to use for all those who would try.

#### 4.Server-Side Components:
Spring Boot with Java,
Spring Data JPA,
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap.
